## Skill Loading

Use the repository’s installed Intent. If it is unavailable, report the missing dependency instead of downloading a replacement.
Before editing files for a substantial task:
- Run `bunx --no-install --package @tanstack/intent intent list` from the workspace root to see available local skills.
- If a listed skill matches the task, run `bunx --no-install --package @tanstack/intent intent load <package>#<skill>` before changing files.
- Use the loaded `SKILL.md` guidance while making the change.
- Monorepos: when working across packages, run the skill check from the workspace root and prefer the local skill for the package being changed.
- Multiple matches: prefer the most specific local skill for the package or concern you are changing; load additional skills only when the task spans multiple packages or concerns.

# Agent guidance

Read `CLAUDE.md` for repository rules and `docs/PRD.md` before product or scope decisions.
Use `docs/technical/BUILD-PLAN.md` as the live task tracker; update its checkbox and proof in the same commit as the work.

## TanStack Intent mapping

Package-specific TanStack Intent guidance is generated after dependencies exist.
Task 2.1 installs the approved workspace packages with `bun install`, then generates the mapping:

```sh
bunx @tanstack/intent@latest install
```

Use the generated mapping to load matching guidance before editing TanStack code.
Do not invent package or skill entries before installation or retain entries for packages absent from this repo.

## graphify

This project has a knowledge graph at graphify-out/ with god nodes, community structure, and cross-file relationships.

When the user types `/graphify`, use the installed graphify skill or instructions before doing anything else.

Rules:
- For codebase questions, first run `graphify query "<question>"` when graphify-out/graph.json exists. Use `graphify path "<A>" "<B>"` for relationships and `graphify explain "<concept>"` for focused concepts. These return a scoped subgraph, usually much smaller than GRAPH_REPORT.md or raw grep output.
- Dirty graphify-out/ files are expected after hooks or incremental updates; dirty graph files are not a reason to skip graphify. Only skip graphify if the task is about stale or incorrect graph output, or the user explicitly says not to use it.
- If graphify-out/wiki/index.md exists, use it for broad navigation instead of raw source browsing.
- Read graphify-out/GRAPH_REPORT.md only for broad architecture review or when query/path/explain do not surface enough context.
- After modifying code, run `graphify update .` to keep the graph current (AST-only, no API cost).
